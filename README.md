No Pollution Sticker Recognition for vehicles in India

This code can identify the PUC sticker in stationary images of car dashboards for Indian vehicles. 
Initial conditions are that the sticker should be clear and should be taken from a good resolution camera.
The angle is somewhat fixed and the image is taken closest to the sticker/dashboard.
